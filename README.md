# Downhash
I always wanted to automatically download my files via a script and have the SHA256 hash sum synchronised,
which is why I created this script. Automatic downloading and chasing through the hash, downhash that is.

## How to run
1. Download the `downhash.sh` file from the github repository.
2. Give the file execute permissions. `chmod +x downhash.sh`
3. Let it run and enter your stuff! `./downhash.sh`

## Features:
